# Status

All orders/requests will be shown in different colors step by step

As you can see from the picture, there are 4 colors:

- <h6 style={{backgroundColor:"red", width:120}}>Red - Pending</h6> (before accepting an order/request)

- <h6 style={{backgroundColor:"yellow", width:150}}>Yellow - In Progress </h6> (after accepted, it means your staff is preparing an order/request)
- <h6 style={{backgroundColor:"#A4C2F4", width:150}}>Blue - Scheduled</h6> (Housekeeping/Maintenance request can be scheduled at a specific time by guest)

**Note:** You will see a Blue one if enabled “Preferred Time” in Housekeeping or Maintenance, it means your guest schedules the time for that service. Once it’s time, the Blue request will be changed in to Red (Pending status).
