# Managing Requests

Manage requests by accepting, completing, or voiding them.

**Accepting a Request:** Click the **Pending (orange)** request, then click **Accept**. If prompted, provide an **ETA** (managed in the Admin Dashboard).

**Completing a Request:** Click **Complete** when done. The request will be removed from the **Task Board** but saved in **History**.

**Voiding a Request:** Click the **trash icon**, select a reason, then click **Void**.

**Guest Cancellations:** If enabled, guests can cancel a **Pending** request, which will then be marked as **“Guest Cancel”**.

**Translations:** Click the **translation icon** to translate guest notes.
