# Line Notify

You can set whether you want to receive notifications on every status of an order/request, or just one or two steps as you want by:

Go to **Settings** > **Notification** > scroll down then you will see **Line Notify Preferences**

Note: To make sure it works properly, we suggest refreshing the admin dashboard/ task board after enabling/disabling a button
