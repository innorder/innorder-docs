# Notification Language

Notification Language can be different from the default language of the system.

You can select which language you prefer to see when orders/requests are notified in your Line Groups.

For example: Your default language is English, but your staff are more familiar with Thai language, so you can select Thai as the Notification Language

To select or change:
Go to **Settings** > **Notification** > Scroll down and you will see **Notification Language**
