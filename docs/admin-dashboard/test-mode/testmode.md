# Test Mode

Test mode is for testing by scanning QR codes that have all features and functions the same as QR codes you provide in guest rooms.

QR codes in Test mode help your team figure out how the software functions before or during implementation, and your test data wonâ€™t affect any real data/report in the admin dashboard.

For example: You just updated new menus, you can use QR Codes in Test Mode to test, and make an order/request as if you were a guest.

Go to **Rooms QR** > toggle the button **Test Mode**

Here you can create new QR codes for testing.
